        <p>I am a Graduate from the New Jersey Institute of Technology with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I have worked as a Teaching Assistant for almost 3 years. 
            In this role, I have bettered my understand of Python and my ability to explain my thoughts in a clear manner. 
            Furthermore, I served as the President and Treasurer of the NJIT Highlanders LoL club. 
            During this time, I managed the club budget, planned and coordinated events, and connected with other clubs and the Student Senate. 
            In addition, I was both a player for one of our competitive teams and the manager for my team and another. 
            As the manager, I would schedule practice and match times in accordance with everyone's schedules. 
            As a player, my team and I managed to win the Riot CLoL Bilgewater Division Tournament. 
            Lastly, for my senior capstone project, my team and I designed both IOS and Android Apps for Radio Garden State, so their mobile listeners can have an app optimized for the phone to use. 
            I was in charge of backend and integration.</p>
